Please create the relevant documents for $ARGUMENTS

To ensure we keep our documentation uptodate, you will need to write two types of documentation for the requested features

#File Structure Conventions

All documents should be created under the Documentation folder. In case it doesn't exist, you should create it at under the root directory. Technical documentation should live under the TechnicalDocs subdirectory. User documenttation should live under the UserDocs subdirectory. The filenames for each feature should follow the convention of {feature name}.md (for technical spec) or {feature name}.html for user documentation.

#Technical Specification 

First - check to see whether an existing docuemetnation exists or not. If in doubt, always ask for clarification to avoid creating duplicates.

The specification should always start with a quick introdction of the particular feature followed by a technical diagram explainig the specific implemtnation details (relevant files, technical challenges, specific implementation details the engineer should pay attention to etc.)

A change log should also be kept at the top of the page if this documentation represents a change to an existing feature rather than a brand new feature.

Please use Documentation/TechnicalDocs/upload CSV File.md as a good example of how to write technical docs.


#User Docuemetnation

First - check to see whether an existing docuemetnation exists or not. If in doubt, always ask for clarification to avoid creating duplicates.

For the user documentation, focus on user value. Explain the feature and its benefits and support it with screenshots where possible.

There is not need to keep a change log here - rather make sure the docuemtnation represents the latest version only. 

Please use Documentation/UserDocs/upload CSV File - Visual Guide.html as a good example of how to write technical docs.

#Other Considerations

Make sure both docs have a cross reference to one another for each of tracking for the engineers.

If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.
